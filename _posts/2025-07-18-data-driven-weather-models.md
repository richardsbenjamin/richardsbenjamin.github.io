## What Are Data-Driven Weather Models and Why Do They Matter?

For decades, weather forecasting has relied on physical simulations run on powerful supercomputers. These numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems simulate the atmosphere by solving fundamental physical equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, over a global grid, evolving forward in time step by step. These simulations are computationally intensive but provide reliable forecasts up to several days ahead.

A similar approach exists in climate science. In the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), hundreds of climate models from research institutions worldwide generate projections over the coming century. These models simulate the Earth system by solving coupled physical equations for atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land, across millions of grid cells and time steps.
